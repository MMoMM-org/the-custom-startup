# Obsidian Plugin Testing Patterns

Vitest setup, mock parity, live-test discipline, hot-reload, and `obsidianmd/*` lint rationale. Patterns that catch bugs unit-mocks alone cannot — and the discipline that keeps the test side from drifting from production.

---

## Type-Check Scope

### Test Files Are Outside the Build

Plugin scaffolds typically set `rootDir: "./src"` so `tsc --noEmit` produces a clean build output. This means TypeScript diagnostics in `tests/**/*.ts` (which Vitest runs through its own pipeline) are not part of `tsc --noEmit`. The IDE may show diagnostics there from the editor's TS server; these are informational only — Vitest's runtime executor doesn't care, and forcing them through `tsc` requires either a separate `tsconfig.test.json` or excluding the file from the production type check.

### Separate `tsconfig.test.json` for Test-Side Type Checking

Maintain a separate config so test-side type checking is explicit and scriptable:

```json
{
  "extends": "./tsconfig.json",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "rootDir": ".",
    "noEmit": true,
    "types": ["node", "vitest/globals"]
  },
  "include": ["src/**/*", "tests/**/*"]
}
```

CI runs `npx tsc -p tsconfig.test.json --noEmit` on PRs touching `tests/`. Without this gate, mocks drift their types from production code without the build catching it — implementer agents will report "build clean" while the test side has unresolved type errors.

---

## Vitest Configuration

### Single-File Obsidian Mock

Vitest configurations alias `obsidian` to one mock file (commonly `tests/fixtures/obsidian-mock.ts`). Every new symbol imported from `obsidian` in `src/` needs a stub in the mock — otherwise the next test that loads that production module crashes with `X is not a constructor`.

Add a phase-gate to the workflow: at the end of each feature, grep for new `from 'obsidian'` imports and mirror them in the mock before merging.

```bash
grep -rn "from ['\"]obsidian['\"]" src/ | sed -E "s/.*from ['\"]obsidian['\"];?.*//" -
# Better: extract the imported symbol set and diff against tests/fixtures/obsidian-mock.ts
```

### Mock Helpers Forward Options Verbatim

Helpers in the Obsidian mock (`createDiv`, `createEl`, `createSpan`, etc.) must forward EVERY option production might use — `cls`, `attr`, `text`, `href`, child arrays, etc. A mock that only handles "what production currently passes" silently breaks the moment a refactor or `eslint --fix` adds a new option. Treat the mock as a contract: missing options become missing assertions in tests.

### Mock Parity Goes Beyond Options

A mock that does the obvious thing (e.g. "`normalizePath` collapses `//` to `/`") may miss a non-obvious behaviour of the real API (e.g. "`normalizePath` also strips leading `/`"). Tests pass, runtime breaks.

**Defence:** at the end of each phase, run the actual built plugin against a real Obsidian once. A 5-minute smoke loop catches the class of bug where production behaviour is not what the mock pretends.

### Modal Testing Pattern

Modals can't be opened in Vitest as-is — `Modal.onOpen()` reaches `activeDocument.activeElement` which doesn't exist. Pattern: in `obsidian-mock.ts`, replace `Modal` with a stub class that captures the constructed instance:

```typescript
export class Modal {
  static _last: Modal | null = null;
  app: App;
  contentEl: HTMLElement;
  constructor(app: App) {
    this.app = app;
    this.contentEl = document.createElement("div");
    Modal._last = this;
  }
  open() { /* no-op in tests */ }
  close() { /* no-op in tests */ }
  onOpen() {}
  onClose() {}
}
```

Tests then assert `Modal._last?.contentEl.querySelector(...)` and call `.close()` directly without touching the DOM.

A cleaner alternative for new code: wrap every Modal as a `static pick(app, args) → Promise<Result>` factory. Production callers `await Cls.pick(app, args)`; tests pass an injected `vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(...)`. This makes test code fully independent of Obsidian's modal lifecycle.

### Phase-Gate Mock Audit

At the end of each implementation phase, before merging:

1. `grep -rn "from 'obsidian'" src/` — any new symbols imported? Mirror them in the mock.
2. Any new `createEl` / `createDiv` options used in `src/`? Mock helper handles them?
3. Any new `vault.adapter.*` calls? (Red flag — should usually be `vault.modify` / `vault.process` etc.)
4. Any new `from 'obsidian'` imports whose mock equivalent has weird behaviour (`normalizePath`, `requestUrl`)? Spot-check the mock against the real API.

## Live Tests

Tests that hit a real Obsidian instance, real Docker daemon, real external API have wildly different timeout characteristics from unit tests (5s+ per assertion vs ms per unit test). Mixing them in one config either makes unit tests slow or live tests time out.

### Two-Config Split

Maintain `vitest.live.config.ts` separate from `vitest.config.ts`:

- Unit config excludes `test/live/**`.
- Live config includes only `test/live/**`, with longer timeouts and different setup hooks.

CI runs unit on every push; live runs manually (or on a separate workflow with secrets).

### Self-Restoring Per-Test, Not Shared-Fixture Rollback

Live-suite tests share state (the running Obsidian / Docker daemon / API account). A `beforeEach` rollback cascades when one test's restore races with the next test's setup — variable reload latency makes this nondeterministic.

Pattern: each test mutates → asserts → explicitly restores its own changes. A `waitForProbe(canary, timeoutMs)` utility is the fallback if cascading recurs. Pre-existing failures DO leak; document and accept.

### Fake Timers vs `prefer-active-window-timers`

`vi.useFakeTimers()` only intercepts global `setInterval` / `setTimeout`. The `obsidianmd/prefer-active-window-timers` lint rule prefers `activeWindow.setInterval`. The two patterns conflict — but the resolution is **not** to disable the lint rule. Disabling any `obsidianmd/*` rule (or any ESLint rule at all) blocks community-plugin submission (see "Why These Rules Matter" below).

The correct resolution is on the test side, not the production side. Production code uses `activeWindow.setInterval` (or `this.registerInterval(window.setInterval(...))`) unconditionally. Tests stub the active-window timer functions directly with `vi.spyOn`:

```typescript
import { vi } from "vitest";

beforeEach(() => {
  // Replace activeWindow's timers with controllable doubles.
  // No useFakeTimers() — it would not intercept activeWindow.* anyway.
  vi.spyOn(activeWindow, "setInterval").mockImplementation((cb: TimerHandler, ms?: number) => {
    return scheduleControllable(cb, ms);  // your test-controlled scheduler
  });
});
```

Or, when the timer logic is the unit under test, extract the scheduling into a small adapter and inject a fake at the call site. The lint rule stays green; the test still has full control of timing; the plugin remains popout-safe.

### Privacy Regression as a Build-Failing Grep Test

When a plugin must guarantee "no user content in logs" (audit log, structured log, telemetry events), encode the rule as a test that greps the relevant source paths for forbidden patterns and fails the build:

```typescript
import { execSync } from "node:child_process";
import { expect, test } from "vitest";

test("no user content interpolated into logs", () => {
  const grep = (pattern: string, paths: string[]) => {
    try {
      return execSync(`grep -rEn "${pattern}" ${paths.join(" ")}`).toString().trim().split("\n");
    } catch {
      return [];
    }
  };
  const offenders = grep(
    "logger\\.(info|warn|debug|error)\\([^,]+,\\s*(chunk|data|stdout|stderr|body)",
    ["src/connection/", "src/ui/chat-view/"]
  );
  expect(offenders).toEqual([]);
});
```

Static rules are not perfect, but they catch the leakiest class — accidentally interpolating a payload into a log message.

## Real-Vault Testing

### First-Light Gate

Plan a real-vault smoke session at roughly 50% of total scope — *not* at feature-complete. UI and API-boundary code are where the bulk of bugs live and unit tests don't see them.

Minimum first-light loop:
1. Build (`npm run dev` running, esbuild watch).
2. Hot-reload into a `test/<plugin-name>/` Obsidian vault.
3. Exercise the happy path of every implemented feature.
4. Fix what breaks, repeat.

The single-day cost of an early first-light session typically saves multi-week hardening cycles later.

### Hot-Reload Setup

Inside the repo, create `test/<plugin-name>/` as an Obsidian vault. Inside its `.obsidian/plugins/<plugin-id>/`, symlink or copy the build output (`main.js`, `manifest.json`, `styles.css`).

With `npm run dev` running, every save updates the linked plugin in the vault. To pick up changes: in Obsidian, Settings → Community Plugins → toggle the plugin off then on. Roughly 30× faster than a full Obsidian restart.

### `hot-reload` Plugin Watches `main.js` mtime — Not `data.json`

If the dev workflow uses the `hot-reload` community plugin, only changes to `main.js` / `styles.css` trigger a reload. Test helpers that mutate `data.json` and expect a reload will time out.

Workarounds:
- `utimesSync(<vault>/.obsidian/plugins/<id>/main.js, ...)` after writing config to fake an mtime change.
- For `data.json`-only changes, the `Plugin.onExternalSettingsChange()` lifecycle hook fires — use it instead of expecting a full reload.

## Why These `obsidianmd/*` ESLint Rules Matter

The `eslint-plugin-obsidianmd` package ships a recommended config — leave it enabled, **and never disable any rule it provides**. Concrete bugs each rule has been observed to prevent:

| Rule | Bug it prevents |
|---|---|
| `obsidianmd/prefer-active-doc` | Popout-window globals — `document.activeElement` reads from main window only |
| `obsidianmd/manage-class` | `el.className = ...` overwriting Obsidian's layout classes |
| `obsidianmd/prefer-active-window-timers` | Timers tied to wrong window in popout (when applicable) |
| `obsidianmd/prefer-create-el` | Direct `document.createElement` bypassing Obsidian's DOM helpers |
| `obsidianmd/no-html-element-creation` | Catches direct `createElement` calls; does NOT catch destructured helpers |
| `obsidianmd/no-forbidden-elements` | Runtime `<style>` injection breaking style ordering |

### Community-Plugin Submission Gate

The Obsidian community-plugin reviewer scans every submission for disabled ESLint rules and **rejects the plugin from official registration if any rule is disabled** — whether via line-level `// eslint-disable*` comments, file-level disables, or `'rule': 'off'` entries in `.eslintrc*`. This applies to **every rule the project's ESLint config loads**, not only `obsidianmd/*` — `@typescript-eslint/*`, base `eslint:recommended`, and any other plugin's rules are equally in-scope.

Primary submission path: the [community.obsidian.md](https://community.obsidian.md/account/plugins) portal (manual). The `obsidianmd/obsidian-releases` PR bot remains active as a legacy/parallel path; both apply the same rule set.

The submission gate has no "justified disable" exception. If a rule conflicts with the code, the only acceptable resolution is to **change the code**, not the rule. If the rule is genuinely wrong for all consumers, raise it upstream with the relevant ESLint plugin maintainers.

This is the single most common reason plugins fail community-plugin review on the first pass.
