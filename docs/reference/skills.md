# Skills Reference

All 23 skills provided by the `tcs-workflow` plugin. Two of them — `implement-direct` and `implement-incremental` — are dispatch targets rather than commands: `/implement` selects one for you, so they carry no slash command of their own.

For the design rationale behind choosing a skill over a subagent or inlining capability into an agent, see [skill-and-agent-design.md](../about/skill-and-agent-design.md).

## Command Reference

### Setup

| Command | Plugin | Purpose | When to use |
|---------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `/constitution` | tcs-workflow | Create or update a project constitution with governance rules | Establish guardrails before any building begins |

### XDD Workflow

| Command | Plugin | Purpose | When to use |
|---------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `/xdd` | tcs-workflow | Orchestrates xdd-prd → xdd-sdd → xdd-plan workflow | Any new feature or significant change — full spec in one command |
| `/xdd-meta` | tcs-workflow | Scaffold, status-check, and manage specification directories | Used internally by `xdd` and `implement`; invoke directly for spec housekeeping |
| `/xdd-prd` | tcs-workflow | Create and validate product requirements documents (PRD) | When writing requirements, user stories, or acceptance criteria |
| `/xdd-sdd` | tcs-workflow | Create and validate solution design documents (SDD) | When designing architecture, interfaces, or technical decisions |
| `/xdd-plan` | tcs-workflow | Create and validate implementation plans (PLAN) | When sequencing work, defining phases, or analyzing dependencies |
| `/xdd-tdd` | tcs-workflow | Enforce the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle per implementation task | At the start of each task — blocks production code until a failing test exists |

### Build

| Command | Plugin | Purpose | When to use |
|---------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `/implement` | tcs-workflow | Entry point that detects a spec's decomposition artifacts and dispatches to the matching execution loop | After spec is validated — routes to `implement-incremental` (phase loop) or `implement-direct` (phase-less) |
| `/validate` | tcs-workflow | Validate specifications, implementations, constitution compliance, or understanding | Before starting implementation; also after to check for drift |

### Quality

| Command | Plugin | Purpose | When to use |
|---------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `/test` | tcs-workflow | Run tests and enforce strict code ownership | After implementation, when fixing bugs, or after refactoring |
| `/review` | tcs-workflow | Multi-agent code review with specialized perspectives (security, performance, patterns, simplification, tests) | Before merging a branch |
| `/receive-review` | tcs-workflow | Process incoming code review feedback — classifies each item as Accept, Push Back, Defer, or Question | When acting on feedback from a human reviewer or `/review` output |

### Maintain

| Command | Plugin | Purpose | When to use |
|---------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `/analyze` | tcs-workflow | Discover and document business rules, technical patterns, and system interfaces | Understanding existing code before changing it |
| `/debug` | tcs-workflow | Systematically diagnose and resolve bugs through conversational investigation and root cause analysis | When something is broken |
| `/document` | tcs-workflow | Generate and maintain documentation for code, APIs, and project components | After implementation; during audits |
| `/refactor` | tcs-workflow | Refactor, simplify, or clean up code for improved maintainability without changing business logic | Cleanup without behavior change |

### Coordination

| Command | Plugin | Purpose | When to use |
|---------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `/parallel-agents` | tcs-workflow | Validate task independence, detect file conflicts, and fan out agents concurrently | When multiple independent tasks can run at the same time |
| `/guide` | tcs-workflow | Read the current branch and open plan to orient around current state | At session start or after a context reset |

### Authoring

| Command | Plugin | Purpose | When to use |
|---------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `/brainstorm` | tcs-workflow | Explore intent, requirements, and design through dialogue before implementation begins | Before writing a spec — validates ideas and surfaces design alternatives |
| `/verify` | tcs-workflow | Require actual command output from tests, builds, or lint before marking a task done | When a task is complete and needs evidence before closure |

## XDD Skills

The six XDD skills form the spec-driven workflow at the heart of the `tcs-workflow` plugin. They move a feature from idea to buildable plan in three stages:

1. **xdd-prd** — captures what to build (requirements, user stories, acceptance criteria)
2. **xdd-sdd** — captures how to build it (architecture, interfaces, technical decisions)
3. **xdd-plan** — sequences the work into phases with TDD structure and compliance gates
4. **xdd-meta** — manages the spec directory lifecycle (IDs, README tracking, phase transitions)
5. **xdd-tdd** — enforces RED-GREEN-REFACTOR at the task level during implementation
6. **xdd** — orchestrator that runs xdd-prd → xdd-sdd → xdd-plan in a single command

The standard workflow is: `/xdd` → `/validate` → `/implement`. Invoke the sub-skills individually when you need finer control over a single stage.
